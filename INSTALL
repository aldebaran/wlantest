Wlantest is packaged using Python distutils.

* To generate source distribution package
    python setup.py sdist

* To install from tarball as root
    python setup.py install

* In order to run wlantest you need the following

    hostapd >= 1.0 (optionally built with CONFIG_IEEE80211N=y)

    dhcpd (optional)

    freeradius

* Freeradius installation and configuration

 On the test machine you can install freeradius package. Then got to the
 /etc/raddb/certs directory and execute:

 $ rm -f *.pem *.der *.csr *.crt *.key *.p12 serial* index.txt*
 $ ./bootstrap

 This will generate new certificates with correct expiry dates.

 Then, edit /etc/raddb/users and add the following line at the beginning of the
 file:

 user Cleartext-Password := "password"

 This will authorize user named "user" with "password" password to authenticate.
